# Does Fracking Induce Earthquakes?

Fracking is the process of drilling down the Earth and injecting fluid into rocks in order to obtain oil and gas. Fracking faces a high amount of critics due to undeniably negative affects it has on the environment, especially because it disguises itself as environmentally friendly. One of these critiques is that fracking causes earthquakes, due to increasing fluid pressures within faults. This data analysis project aims to discover whether or not fracking-induced earthquakes is a major concern for the environment or not.
