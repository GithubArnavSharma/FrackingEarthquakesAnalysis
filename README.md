# Does Fracking Induce Earthquakes?

Fracking is the process of drilling down the Earth and injecting fluid into rocks in order to obtain oil and gas. Fracking faces a high amount of critics due to undeniably negative affects it has on the environment, especially because it disguises itself as environmentally friendly. One of these critiques is that fracking causes earthquakes, due to increasing fluid pressures within faults. This data analysis project aims to discover whether or not fracking-induced earthquakes is a major concern for the environment or not.

As a starting point to the project, basic data analysis was conducted on data of fracking projects from 2011-12. From there, it was concluded that:

1. There it little correlation between the vertical depth of a fracking project and the amount of water the project consumes. There is also little difference in the vertical depth and water consumption of gas and oil fracking operations.

2. Some fracking companies are much bigger than others, and do much more operations. The top 5% of fracking corporations do more than 50% of operations.

3. While the majority of fracking is done in Middle America, some outer states such as California, Alaska, and Pennsylvania are prime spots for operations.
