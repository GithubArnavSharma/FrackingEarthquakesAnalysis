# Does Fracking Induce Earthquakes?

Fracking is the process of drilling down the Earth and injecting fluid into rocks in order to obtain oil and gas. Fracking faces a high amount of critics due to undeniably negative affects it has on the environment, especially because it disguises itself as environmentally friendly. One of these critiques is that fracking causes earthquakes, due to increasing fluid pressures within faults. This data analysis project aims to discover whether or not fracking-induced earthquakes is a major concern for the environment or not.

As a starting point to the project, basic data analysis was conducted on data of fracking projects from 2011-12. From there, it was concluded that:

1. There it little correlation between the vertical depth of a fracking project and the amount of water the project consumes. There is also little difference in the vertical depth and water consumption of gas and oil fracking operations.

2. Some fracking companies are much bigger than others, and do much more operations. The top 5% of fracking corporations do more than 50% of operations.

3. While the majority of fracking is done in Middle America, some outer states such as California, Alaska, and Pennsylvania are prime spots for operations.

The next step was to analyze data for earthquakes. Two datasets were used; one was information of all 2.5+ magnitude earthquakes in 2013, and the other was the same except for the earthquakes taking place in 1993. From there, it was concluded that:

1. There is little correlation between the depth of an earthquake and its magnitude. Furthermore, only a handful of earthquakes are explosions, rock burst, etc.. Both of these statements have not changed from 1993 to 2013.

2. From 1993 to 2013, more networks have been used to report earthquake locations. While 'nc' and 'ci' still remain popular, new ones such as 'tul' are being used often.

3. As technology for earthquakes has progressed from 1993-2013, so have the methods for measuring magnitude. While 'ml' still remains popular, other old ones such as 'mc' have stopped being used.

4. While in Middle America, the amount of earthquakes on average has increased from 1993-2013, in some states such as California, the amount of earthquakes have decreased.
